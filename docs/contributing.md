Welcome to the File Tag project! We're excited to have you on board. This guide will walk you through the process of contributing to our project, including reporting issues, pull requests, coding standards, testing requirements, and documentation guidelines.

Reporting Issues
---------------

If you've found a bug or have a feature request, please report it on our GitHub issue tracker. You can do this by clicking on the [Report a üêõ or Request a ‚≠ê](https://github.com/charudatta10/file_tag/issues) button in the README file.

Pull Request Process
---------------------

If you've made changes to the codebase, please submit a pull request. Here's an overview of the process:

1. **Create a new branch**: From the main branch (main.py), create a new branch for your changes using `git branch <branch_name>`.
2. **Make changes**: Make the necessary changes to the code and commit them using `git add .` and `git commit -m "commit message"`.
3. **Push the branch**: Push the new branch to our GitHub repository using `git push origin <branch_name>`.
4. **Submit a pull request**: Go to the GitHub repository and submit a pull request from your branch.

Please ensure that your pull request follows these guidelines:

* Your pull request title should include a brief description of the changes.
* Your pull request body should explain what changes were made and why.
* You must include any new code or updates in the pull request.

Coding Standards
----------------

We follow standard Python coding conventions, including:

* PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal 8)
* Docstrings for functions and classes
* Meaningful variable names
* Consistent indentation

You can view our full coding standards document [here](SECURITY.md).

Testing Requirements
-------------------

To ensure the quality of our project, we require all pull requests to include:

* Unit tests: Your code should have sufficient unit tests to cover its functionality.
* Integration tests: Your code should also pass integration tests to verify its interactions with other components.

You can view our testing requirements document [here](SECURITY.md).

Documentation Guidelines
